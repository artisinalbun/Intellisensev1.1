NEW YORK (AP) — Tax season is underway, and the IRS expects 140 million people will file returns by April 15. The agency has also debuted a new online tool to help taxpayers check the status of any refund they may be entitled to.
President Donald Trump this week offered all federal employees a buyout package in an effort to reduce the size of the government workforce, which could impact IRS staffing at an important period for the agency, though it’s not yet clear how. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If you file your tax return electronically, the IRS says it should take 21 days or less to receive your refund. If you choose to receive your refund with direct deposit, it should take even less time.

Federal authorities have arrested a former Federal Reserve senior adviser for allegedly giving inside economic information to China.
A grand jury indictment accuses John Harold Rogers, 63, of Vienna, Virginia, of stealing Federal Reserve trade secrets and selling them to Chinese intelligence officials for at least $450,000 by posing as a university professor in China.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover.
Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Chopra’s tenure saw the removal of medical debt from credit reports and limits on overdrafts penalties, all based on the premise that the financial system could be fairer and more competitive in ways that helped consumers. But many in the financial industry viewed his actions as regulatory overreach.
In a social media post Saturday about his departure, Chopra thanked people across the country who “shared their ideas and experiences” with the government’s consumer financial watchdog agency.",2025-02-01T15:02:01,AP News,"Trump, Rohit Chopra, Jacquelyn Martin, Donald Trump, Rohit Chopra, Biden, Chopra, Trump, Chopra, Chopra",10,"F, South Court Auditorium, Washington","the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, White House, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau",4,1

Witnesses said the man was conscious following the fall at the Attitash Mountain Resort in Bartlett about 12:15 p.m. Sunday. He was taken to a hospital, the state fire marshal’s office said in a news release.
“Based on the preliminary investigation, it appears a mechanical failure caused one of the chairs to dislodge from the cable,” the marshal’s office said. No one else was hurt and all other passengers on the lift at the time were unloaded normally at the top of the lift.

The High Court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90% of the company’s debt have already backed the deal.
Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.

BERLIN (AP) — German beer sales declined last year even as the country hosted the European Football Championship, continuing a long-term downward trend that has seen sales drop by more than 10% in the past decade to their lowest level since at least the early 1990s.
Official figures released Monday showed that German-based breweries and distributors sold about 8.3 billion liters (nearly 2.2 billion gallons) of beer last year, which was a 1.4% decline on the previous year. The figure doesn’t include non-alcoholic beer and beer imported from outside the European Union.
The latest figure was not as steep as the 4.5% drop seen in 2023, when sales resumed their downward slide after a recovery at home and in the EU following the end of COVID-19 restrictions. But, after years in which sales have mostly dropped, they were 13.7% lower last year than they were in 2014, the Federal Statistical Office said.",2025-02-03T09:58:16,AP News,Matthias Schrader,1,"Germany, Munich","Augustiner, EU, the Federal Statistical Office",3,1

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury’s verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google’s Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.
In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco’s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple’s antitrust trial in 2021.
Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn’t have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",2025-02-03T22:50:04,AP News,"Richard Drew, Jessica Ellsworth, Ellsworth",3,"San Francisco, New York","Google, the Play Store, Google, Google, Google, Android, Epic Games, Google, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google, Apple, Google, Apple",13,1

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Hockey League Players’ Association and Professional Hockey Players’ Association are affiliating with the AFL-CIO and joining the labor organization’s sports council, they announced Monday.
Their membership brings the number of unions involved in the AFL-CIO, the biggest labor federation in the U.S., to 63, representing more than 15 million workers. It comes as collective bargaining talks are ongoing at multiple levels of the sport.
“Whether our work is on the rink, in the classroom or on the factory floor, every worker deserves a voice on the job and the power that comes with union membership,” AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler said. “We are thrilled to welcome the NHLPA and the PHPA into the federation and our Sports Council, and we look forward to supporting their work to ensure strong union contracts, fair wages, safe working conditions and professional development opportunities for professional hockey players.”",2025-02-04T00:35:07,AP News,"Marty Walsh, Nathan Denette, Liz Shuler",3,"NHL, AFL, CIO","NHL Players’ Association, Professional Hockey Players’ Association, the AFL-CIO, NHLPA, the Florida Panthers, the Edmonton Oilers, The Canadian Press, AP, The National Hockey League Players’ Association, Professional Hockey Players’ Association, the AFL-CIO, the AFL-CIO, AFL-CIO, NHLPA, PHPA, Sports Council",16,1

NEW YORK (AP) — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction on Friday at Sotheby’s in New York.
The auction house is estimating the value of the “Joachim-Ma Stradivarius” at $12 million to $18 million.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.
Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly — rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, when he’ll make an additional Helene appeal.
At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year “so that people can get their lives back together.”",2025-02-03T21:20:21,AP News,"Josh Stein, Kamala Harris, Nell Redmond, Josh Stein, Stein",5,"RALEIGH, Charlotte, Raleigh",General Assembly,1,1

QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — Ecuador’s conservative president said Monday that he is raising tariffs on Mexican imports in a move that echoes the trade barriers that U.S. President Donald Trump announced — but then paused — against Mexico.
Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers. But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.

The drugmaker plans to temporarily pause shipments of its Gardasil vaccine to China at least through the middle of the year. Chairman and CEO Robert Davis told analysts the pause will help pare inventory and support the drugmaker’s commercialization partner in China, which owns the inventory.
He said market dynamics in China that include a soft economy and weak consumer demand remain challenging. Gardasil sales have slumped there for a few quarters.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The website of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek, whose chatbot became the most downloaded app in the United States, has computer code that could send some user login information to a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company that has been barred from operating in the United States, security researchers say.
The web login page of DeepSeek’s chatbot contains heavily obfuscated computer script that when deciphered shows connections to computer infrastructure owned by China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company. The code appears to be part of the account creation and user login process for DeepSeek.
In its privacy policy, DeepSeek acknowledged storing data on servers inside the People’s Republic of China. But its chatbot appears more directly tied to the Chinese state than previously known through the link revealed by researchers to China Mobile.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn’t enough to offset investors’ worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.
The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.
Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year’s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",2025-02-04T21:35:57,AP News,Juliana Yamada,1,"1000 Colonial Farm Rd, McLean, VA 22101","Google, Made By Google, Google, Google, Google, Alphabet Inc., Alphabet, FactSet Research",8,1

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Elon Musk’s lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire’s request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a “stretch” for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn’t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.
But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn’t stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",2025-02-04T20:16:45,AP News,"Elon Musk’s, Elon Musk, Kevin Lamarque, Elon Musk’s, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, Musk",6,"1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460","OpenAI, AP, OpenAI, OpenAI, OpenAI, Microsoft",6,1

When shopping for a used car, many buyers struggle to know if paying extra for a certified pre-owned one is worth it. Buying a certified pre-owned vehicle, commonly called a CPO vehicle, has benefits and drawbacks. Understanding the differences can help you make an informed choice that aligns with your budget, priorities and desire for peace of mind. Here Edmunds editors take an in-depth look at the benefits, limitations and considerations for each.
Certified pre-owned vehicles are used vehicles that have been inspected and refurbished by a dealership to meet specific quality standards determined by the manufacturer. They typically come with a manufacturer-backed warranty, roadside assistance and other perks.
One of the primary benefits of a certified pre-owned vehicle is the assurance of quality. These cars undergo an inspection process — often encompassing 100 to 200 points — to ensure they meet safety, performance and cosmetic standards. Any necessary repairs or replacements are completed before the vehicle is put up for sale. Buyers also benefit from additional protections, such as extended manufacturer warranties that often cover major components and systems beyond the original factory warranty.",2025-02-05T11:30:06,AP News,David Zalubowski,1,"1111 Constitution Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC 20224","Edmunds, Unsold, Colorado, Chevrolet, Edmunds",5,1

Unions are discouraging nurses from accepting the offer, and leaders say an exodus would directly and immediately affect the care of its 9.1 million enrolled veterans.
“We’re already facing a staffing crisis in our hospitals,” said Irma Westmoreland, a registered nurse who heads the Veterans Affairs unit for National Nurses United. “We cannot afford to lose any more staff.”",2025-02-05T19:47:40,AP News,"Trump, Doug Collins, Donald Trump, J.

(AP) — Providence and nurses at its eight Oregon hospitals have reached a tentative agreement after 26 days of strike, in what the state’s nurses union has described as the largest health care strike in state history.
Most of the 5,000 on strike were nurses, but dozens of doctors at a Portland hospital and at six women’s health clinics also participated. The strike came after more than a year of negotiations failed to produce an agreement over wages, benefits and staffing levels.
Key provisions of the tentative agreement with hospital nurses include wage increases and automatic penalty pay for missed breaks or lunch, the Oregon Nurses Association union said in a news release late Tuesday. It came after a week of in-person mediation requested by Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek.
Ratification votes will begin Thursday, the union said. Nurses will remain on strike during the vote and return to work if the agreement is ratified.",2025-02-05T18:38:35,AP News,Tina Kotek,1,"1000 Colonial Farm Rd, McLean, VA 22101","Providence, AP, Providence, Oregon Nurses Association",4,1

A Chicago Transit Authority train heading toward downtown crashed into a slow-moving snow plow that was on the rails on Nov. 16, 2023. Thirty-eight people were hurt, including the train’s operator.
A National Transportation Safety Board report concluded three factors were behind the crash. An “aggressive” speed limit and the CTA’s decision to disable an automatic track brake application delayed response time. It also noted fallen leaves and a “a black gel-like” material on the rails created slippery conditions.

LONDON (AP) — Some of those who lost loved ones in the fire that ripped through London’s Grenfell Tower in 2017 have blasted government plans to demolish the shell of the apartment block, which they want to preserve as a monument to the 72 people who died in the blaze.
Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner met with relatives and survivors on Wednesday to discuss the government’s decision ahead of a formal announcement on Friday. Grenfell United, which represents some of the bereaved, claimed their voices had been ignored.
“Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower,’’ the group said. “She refused to confirm how many bereaved and survivors had been spoken to in the recent, short four-week consultation.’’",2025-02-06T09:51:11,AP News,"Kirsty Wigglesworth, Angela Rayner, Angela Rayner",3,"1111 Constitution Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC 20224",Grenfell United,1,1

HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii’s Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday over insurance issues that are tying up a potential $4 billion settlement over Maui’s catastrophic 2023 wildfire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.
The massive inferno decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying thousands of properties and causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.
A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",2025-02-06T06:03:13,AP News,Jae C.

The changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at rooting out DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.
DEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks.
